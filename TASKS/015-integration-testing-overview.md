# Task 015: Integration Testing Strategy - Overview

## Overview
This task has been split into 6 sequential subtasks to implement comprehensive integration testing for AI-dependent functionality in LangBridge.

## Subtasks

### Phase 1: Foundation (Required)
1. **[Task 015.1](./015-1-deterministic-tests.md)** - Deterministic Foundation Tests
   - Mock-based tests with 100% predictable outcomes
   - Tests our code logic independent of LLM behavior
   - ~200-300 lines

2. **[Task 015.2](./015-2-test-infrastructure.md)** - Test Infrastructure and Helpers
   - Shared test data, helpers, and custom assertions
   - Reusable components for all integration tests
   - ~300-400 lines

### Phase 2: Core Integration (Required)
3. **[Task 015.3](./015-3-high-confidence-tests.md)** - High-Confidence Extraction Tests
   - Simple scenarios with 95%+ expected success
   - Validates basic LLM integration
   - ~200-250 lines

4. **[Task 015.4](./015-4-progressive-complexity-tests.md)** - Progressive Complexity Tests
   - Graduated difficulty levels
   - Documents success rates across complexity
   - ~250-300 lines

### Phase 3: Robustness (Required)
5. **[Task 015.5](./015-5-resilience-tests.md)** - Resilience and Error Handling Tests
   - Edge cases and failure modes
   - Ensures graceful degradation
   - ~200-250 lines

### Phase 4: Advanced (Optional)
6. **[Task 015.6](./015-6-multi-model-tests.md)** - Multi-Model Comparison Tests
   - Cross-model performance analysis
   - Optional but valuable for insights
   - ~150-200 lines

## Implementation Order
Tasks should be implemented sequentially:
- 015.1 → 015.2 → 015.3 → 015.4 → 015.5 → (015.6 optional)

## Total Estimated Effort
- Required tasks (015.1-015.5): ~1,150-1,400 lines
- Optional task (015.6): ~150-200 lines
- Total: ~1,300-1,600 lines of test code

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Manageable chunks**: Each task is 200-400 lines (within PR limits)
2. **Clear dependencies**: Sequential implementation with clear prerequisites
3. **Incremental value**: Each task provides immediate testing value
4. **Flexible scope**: Optional tasks can be deferred
5. **Focused PRs**: Each PR has a single, clear purpose

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive test coverage for AI-dependent functionality
- Clear separation between code bugs and model limitations
- Documented model behavior patterns
- Robust error handling verification
- Performance baselines established
